# Studying Object Oriented Programming and C++

This repository contains the solution and example codes I worked on while studying the book
"Deciphering Object-Oriented Programming with C++" by Dorothy R. Kirk [0]. Most of the example
codes are identical to those found in the companion repository for the book [1]. The solutions for the end of chapter questions were completed myself with parts of the codes referencing the examples.
